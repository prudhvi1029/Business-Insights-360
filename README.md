## Project Objective:
AltiQ Hardware, a global leader in computers and accessories, faced unexpected losses after opening a store in America. These setbacks were identified to be caused due to reliance on outdated methods such as Excel for data analysis. To address this issue, the company's leadership recognized the need for a transformative approach to leveraging data for informed decision-making. With competitors boasting robust analytics teams, AltiQ Hardware recognizes the urgent need to develop its analytics capabilities using Power BI to thrive in the industry.

- Home Page: Central navigation for Dashboard.
- Finance: Enhances financial planning.
- Sales: Boosts revenue and market share.
- Marketing: Elevates brand visibility.
- Supply Chain: Optimizes inventory management.
- Executive: Provides top management overview.

## Tools used:
1. Microsoft Power BI: for Data ETL, Data Modelling, Data Visualization & Dashboarding
