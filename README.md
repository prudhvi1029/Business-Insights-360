## Problem Statement:
AltiQ Hardware, a global leader in computers and accessories, faced unexpected losses after opening a store in America. These setbacks were identified to be caused due to reliance on outdated methods such as Excel for data analysis. To address this issue, the company's leadership recognized the need for a transformative approach to leveraging data for informed decision-making. With competitors boasting robust analytics teams, AltiQ Hardware recognizes the urgent need to develop its analytics capabilities using Power BI to thrive in the industry.

To outshine competitors, they've adopted Power BI for analytics with 1.8 million transaction records from Excel, CSV, and MySQL.
